# AURA: Vision-Controlled IoT-Enabled Robotic Arm

> Bridging the Complexity Gap in Industrial Robotics

## 🚀 Overview

**AURA** is a breakthrough no-code robotics system that democratizes industrial automation. Using computer vision and AI, workers can control precision robotic arms without any programming knowledge—just show the robot what to do.

### Key Innovation
- **No-Code Operation**: Workers control robots through hand gestures, not code
- **Ultra-Affordable**: Prototype built for <$100, scalable to <$30 in production
- **Industrial-Grade Safety**: Replaces dangerous manual labor with precision automation
- **Pure Accessibility**: Designed for everyone—no PhD required

## 📋 Project Status

**🔬 Research Paper**: Currently in publication process with a leading international conference  
**📚 Full Documentation**: Will be released upon peer-review completion  
**💻 Source Code**: Coming soon after academic publication
